# breathcenter

"What's going on right now?" is an enormous question--one that is a fundamental to the human experience. Social Media has created a new outlet for the inquiry. Breath center is a little project / service that aims to introduce people to an internal grounding from the perspective, by asking people to share what their breath is like.


TlDR; Breathcenter is a webapp built in clojure(script) that hopes to inspire people to think about their immediacy.
